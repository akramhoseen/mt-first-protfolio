                I am an easy-going person with a positive attitude towards life. I am a simple, softspoken,
                respectful,
                an educated person with the right mix of modern and traditional
                cultures. I graduated with BSC(Honâ€™s) in Computer science &Engineering from State
                University Of Bangladesh. I am Allah-fearing and read the Quran every day and perform
                the Namaz five times a day.
                I love good food and I also dabble in cooking whenever I get a chance at home.

            <p>Web development bootcamps typically take 3-4 months to complete and teach all the skills you need to
                qualify for a web developer job. Learning web development from online courses could take anywhere from a
                single month to several years, depending on how much time you devote to your courses.</p>
